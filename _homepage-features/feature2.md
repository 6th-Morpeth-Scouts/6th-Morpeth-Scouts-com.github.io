Each week, we help our Beavers, Cubs and Scouts develop the skills to succeed in life. But this can only happen thanks to our brilliant volunteers.

Volunteering is easier than you think. Whether you can spare an hour a month or a day a year, we have opportunities both behind the scenes and directly supporting young people. With full support and training, you can volunteer on a flexible basis.

Not only is it incredibly rewarding and great fun, you’ll learn some brilliant skills transferable to the workplace and further education.

We welcome volunteers from every community and background. You don’t need to have been a Scout. You just need to believe in a more positive future and the difference we can make together.

Volunteer today and help us prepare more young people with Skills for Life.
