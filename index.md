Here at 6th Morpeth Scouts we offer a range of activities, challenges and experiences to engage and support young people in their personal development, empowering them to make a positive contribution to society.

The Scouting programme provides a structure of badges and awards, which are progressive through the sections, and based on a number of objectives.

Our programme is based around three main themes: outdoor and adventure, world and skills. This programme of activities is planned by the leadership team in partnership with young people, and should incorporates elements from each theme, to offer young people the most interesting and diverse experience.
