# 6thmorpethscouts - info for editors

## Content 
The site uses a 'content management system' called Netlify CMS. You can edit the content easily through Netlify (which then pushed the changes to this Github repository) or edit the files directly in Github. Netlify gives you a user-friendly interface for editing and means you don't really need to know any Markdown.

## Images
Images can be uploaded when editing through Netlify. If uploading directly to Github, all images should be uploaded to the 'images' folder. 

Other than the 'hero' image (the full width image) on the homepage, all other images are saved at 600x400 pixels (and 72dpi/pixels per inch) and will scale depending on where they appear on the site (e.g. images in the 3 columns on the homepage will appear smaller than an image added within the body of the Beavers page). Save all your images at 600x400 for consistency. 

## Site setup
### Layout templates
These are files that control the layout of the pages. Editing these can break your site! They are found in the \_layouts folder. There are 3 layouts, one for the homepage, one for section pages (i.e. Cubs, Scouts) and a generic layout (without the features boxes that appear on section pages)

### \_includes
These are parts that are reused across the site, such as the header (navigation) and footer that appear on every page. Again, editing these can break your site!

### homepage-features
These are the items that appear in the three columns/boxes on the homepage, before the footer section. Again, these can be edited and created through Netlify.

## Deleting and creating new pages
This cannot be done through Netlify. To create a page/delete a page ...instructions to follow.
