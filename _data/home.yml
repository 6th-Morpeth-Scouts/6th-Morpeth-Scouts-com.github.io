    At 6th Morpeth Scouts we offer a range of activities, challenges and
    experiences to engage and support young people in their personal
    development, empowering them to make a positive contribution to society.


    Our programme is based around three main themes: **outdoor & adventure**, **world** and **skills**. This programme of activities is planned by the leadership team in partnership with young people, and incorporates elements from each theme, to offer young people the most interesting and diverse experience.
