Scouts are the third section of the Scouting movement. There are over 28 million members worldwide, and in the UK alone there are over 499,000 boys and girls involved in Scouting.Â 

Scouts offer a wide range of interests from Information Technology, street sports, camping, entertainment, quad biking, yachting and conservation. As well as the outdoor activities, Scouts participate in a balanced programme that helps them find out about the world they live in, the importance of keeping fit, and knowing their abilities.
